If that's the case, return and end. There is no more to process in the array. The else of the second \"if\" block calls mystery again, but this time sets the numVals length one shorter. The mystery method runs again. If there is a match (i.e. first \"if\" block is true), k = 1 meaning that when the stack unwinds 1 will be added to the overall return value. "
