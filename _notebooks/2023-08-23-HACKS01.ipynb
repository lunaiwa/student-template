    "Go forward with information provided in all the lessons up to now and try to complete a home page for a project and make a new .md file in _posts for one of the hacks describe below. Connect the hack with the home page, index.md. These items listed are considered prevalent on the internet. In this Teachers opinion, this is more of finding and moving code into your project, not so much a development project. This process is to finding code, learning the pieces, and then moving into your project is called integration. If you are doing a lot of coding, you may be over working the coding part, focus more on the integration part!\n",

    "Overall, this project offers a good foundation for high school students to dive into web development using GitHub Pages. It provides guidance on creating a home page, integrating content and features, and suggests fun and engaging projects for students to explore. With the provided links and hacks, students should have plenty of resources and ideas to start building their own GitHub Pages projects."
