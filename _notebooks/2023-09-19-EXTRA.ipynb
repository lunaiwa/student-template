    "Even though this was my second time attending this meeting, I was able to gain more insights into computer science and how to pursue it as both a career and a major. Some of the college approaches discussed were similar to last year, but what caught me by surprise was the revelation that UCSD's computer science program operates on a lottery system. Additionally, I learned that the way some design students submit their UI/UX portfolios closely mirrors the process for traditional art portfolios. Now, I'm motivated to create my own portfolio and dedicate my time to building and crafting mockups of websites. Sources like LeetCode have emerged as crucial tools for the hiring and job application processes, offering a glimpse into what future job applications might resemble. A personal website serves as an excellent platform for businesses and organizations to review your work, allowing you to showcase your projects and track your progress. I'm particularly keen on continuing my pursuit of UI/UX design and plan to initiate a redesigning project soon. At UCSD, it's common for design students to utilize Figma, and I've found that ChatGPT is an easily accessible resource for code snippets related to web design. Additionally, there's an abundance of frontend (UI/UX) resources available. If you locate a teacher's GitHub repository, you can access their entire course, which proves to be a valuable resource."
