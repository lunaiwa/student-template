    "- CSS is the default technology that most programmers use when styling webpage. It is one of the 3 fundamental web technologies along with HTML and JavaScript. HTML manages the structure, JavaScript makes pages interactive, and CSS changes the style by taking a markup language like HTML and describes how it should be presented to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "- However, CSS is not very easy to work with lacking a lot features often making using CSS very confusing and difficult or hard to work with on lengthy projects. This is why there are tools like Bootstrap, Sass, and Tailwind that make styling a lot easier and more efficient. We will be using Sass in this course.  \n",
