Connect the hack with the home page, index.md. These items listed are considered prevalent on the internet. In this Teachers opinion, this is more of finding and moving code into your project, not so much a development project. This process is to finding code, learning the pieces, and then moving into your project is called integration. If you are doing a lot of coding, you may be over working the coding part, focus more on the integration part!\n",
