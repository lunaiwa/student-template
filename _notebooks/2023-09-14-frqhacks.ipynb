    "This question involves the **AppointmentBook** class, which provides methods for students to schedule appointments with their teacher. Appointments can be scheduled during one of eight class periods during the school day, numbered 1 through 8. A requested appointment had a duration, which is the number of minutes the appointment will last. The 60 minutes within a period are numbered 0 through 59. In order for an appointemnt to be scheudled, the teacher must ave a block of consecutive, available minutes that contains at least the requested number of minutes in a requested period. Scheudled appointments must start and end within the same period.\n",
