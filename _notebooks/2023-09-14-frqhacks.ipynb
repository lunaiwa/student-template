    "In Java, methods are blocks of code within classes that perform specific tasks or functions. They are defined with a name, optional parameters, and an optional return type, and they can be invoked (called) from other parts of the program to execute the code within them. Methods help organize and modularize code, making it easier to read, maintain, and reuse, and they are a fundamental building block of Java programs, allowing developers to encapsulate functionality and promote code reusability."

    "Control structures in Java are constructs that govern the flow of a program by allowing you to make decisions and control the execution of code. The primary control structures in Java include if-else statements, switch statements, loops (such as for, while, and do-while loops), and branching mechanisms like break and continue. These structures enable developers to create conditions, loops, and branching logic, empowering them to execute specific code blocks based on conditions, iterate through data, and control the program's flow, ultimately enhancing the program's logic and functionality."

Appointments can be scheduled during one of eight class periods during the school day, numbered 1 through 8. A requested appointment had a duration, which is the number of minutes the appointment will last. The 60 minutes within a period are numbered 0 through 59. In order for an appointemnt to be scheudled, the teacher must ave a block of consecutive, available minutes that contains at least the requested number of minutes in a requested period. Scheudled appointments must start and end within the same period.\n",
