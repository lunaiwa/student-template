    "In Java, methods are blocks of code within classes that perform specific tasks or functions. They are defined with a name, optional parameters, and an optional return type, and they can be invoked (called) from other parts of the program to execute the code within them. Methods help organize and modularize code, making it easier to read, maintain, and reuse, and they are a fundamental building block of Java programs, allowing developers to encapsulate functionality and promote code reusability."

The primary control structures in Java include if-else statements, switch statements, loops (such as for, while, and do-while loops), and branching mechanisms like break and continue. These structures enable developers to create conditions, loops, and branching logic, empowering them to execute specific code blocks based on conditions, iterate through data, and control the program's flow, ultimately enhancing the program's logic and functionality."
