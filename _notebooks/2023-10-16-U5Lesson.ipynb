    "### Impacts\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming affects the world in many ways, such as socially, economically, and culturally. For instance, not everyone has the same access to technology and computer programs, which creates social inequalities. Some people can use technology, while others can't. **Digital Divide**\n",
    "\n",
    "The global economy relies heavily on technology and computer programs, especially in areas like stock trading and economic predictions. Programming and technology have also made the world more connected, allowing different cultures to mix and making it easier for people to communicate globally. However, this has also created a gap between generations, with younger people having more exposure to digital technology than older generations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**These impacts on society, the economy, and culture can be both good and bad.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### System Reliability\n",
    "\n",
    "When programmers create software, they need to consider how reliable the system is. Different devices can perform the same task at varying speeds and in different ways. Each system may have security issues that hackers can exploit.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make systems more reliable, programmers need to fix any bugs as soon as they find them. These fixes are then released to users as updates or patches to ensure that computers can be used safely and correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intellectual Property\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, when people create programs on the internet, they own them. However, open source programs blur this line. In open source programs, anyone can make improvements to the code if the program owner allows it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Licensing and access also play a role in letting others adapt and build on existing code to create their own programs. There are different types of licenses, like Creative Commons and MIT License, each serving different purposes.\n",
