    "- An **element** is a single value in the **array**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The __**index**__ of an **element** is the position of the element in the **array**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - In java, the **first element** of an array is at **index 0**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **length** of an **array** is the number of elements in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **`length`** is a `public final` data member of an array\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Since `length` is `public`, we can access it in **any class**!\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Since `length` is `final` we cannot change an array's `length` after it has been created\n",
    "    - In Java, the **last element** of an array named `list` is at **index** `list.length -1`"
