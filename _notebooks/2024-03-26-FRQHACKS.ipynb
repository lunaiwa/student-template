    "### Question 1 - Pojos and Access Control:\n",
    "\n",
    "Situation: The school librarian wants to create a program that stores all of the books within the library in a database and is used to manage their inventory of books available to the students. You decided to put your amazing code skills to work and help out the librarian!\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Describe the key differences between the private and public access controllers and how it affects a POJO\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Identify a scenario when you would use the private vs. public access controllers that isnâ€™t the one given in the scenario above\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Create a Book class that represents the following attributes about a book: title, author, date published, person holding the book and make sure that the objects are using a POJO, the proper getters and setters and are secure from any other modifications that the program makes later to the objects"

    "a. Key Differences between Private and Public Access Controllers:\n",
    "\n",
    "Public Access Modifier (public): When a class member (variable or method) is declared as public, it can be accessed from any other class. This means that the member is visible to any other class, regardless of the package in which it is declared. Public members are accessible to all other classes and can be used to interact with the object of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Private Access Modifier (private): When a class member is declared as private, it can only be accessed within the same class in which it is declared. It cannot be accessed or modified directly by any other class. Private members are encapsulated within the class, making them inaccessible from outside the class. They are typically used to hide implementation details and ensure data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Impact on POJO (Plain Old Java Object): In a POJO, private access controllers are often used to encapsulate the internal state of an object, providing controlled access to its attributes through getter and setter methods. Public access controllers, on the other hand, are used to expose certain behavior or attributes of the object to external classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Scenario of Using Private vs. Public Access Controllers:\n",
    "\n",
    "Private Access Controller: Suppose you're designing a banking application. Within a BankAccount class, you'd likely have attributes such as balance, accountNumber, and ownerName. It's crucial to ensure that balance and accountNumber are private because they contain sensitive information that should not be directly accessible or modified from outside the BankAccount class. Thus, you would use private access controllers to protect these attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Public Access Controller: However, you might have methods like depositMoney() and withdrawMoney() which should be accessible to external classes to interact with the BankAccount object. These methods would be declared as public, allowing other classes to use them to deposit or withdraw money from the account."
